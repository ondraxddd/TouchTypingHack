# How to use? 
Simly click on "Code" -> Download Zip. Once the ZIP file is downloaded extract it and run "Hack.exe". The hacks UI should pop up.<br>

Start by clicking on the "Scan" button. Every time you run the app it will want you to select the area where the app should take text from, so new, almost tranparent window will be opened. Drag and resize the window by your needs and as the text is selected properly hit "Screenshot". Main window will be shown again, this time with filled out the text box. If you wish to re-select text area without restarting the app there is "select area" button on the right bottom corner. You can insert the text manually if scanning doesnt work. You can set some properties, as speed, inverted inputing or number of loops. After you click "Start" you have 2.5 seconds to click to the app/text box where the text should be filled in. <br>
# Features
### Hidden mode
Hidden mode (next to minimalize and exit buttons in top bar) allows you to hide the app icon from windows bottom panel. Might be useful in school if the teacher is walking around, but it's more like beta function because it's not tested enough yet.
### Customziable speed
Icons speak for themselfes.
### Invertion
Does your TouchTyping software want you to type from the end to the beginnig? No problem. Just tick the Invertion mode.
### Loops
You can enter how many times should be the text inputed. Space between each loop should be added automatically.
# Might come with the future
1) "Stop" button to stop entering the text
2) Option to enter a text beginnig on or containg a specific charater(s)
3) Re-workded graphic
# Importnant
Please consider this is my first ever project and the OCR (technique used to read) isn't the best as the better ones are quite pricy, so it might not always work as it should.
